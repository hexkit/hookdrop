# Webhook Tunnel

A minimal, open-source HTTP webhook tunnel service built with FastAPI.

This project allows you to create temporary webhook URLs that forward incoming HTTP requests to your specified `target_url`. Useful for testing, debugging, or capturing events from third-party services.

---

- üîÅ Forward any HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.)
- üõ£Ô∏è Supports nested paths: `/hook/{id}/path/to/resource`
- üì¶ Request body and headers forwarding
- üß† TO DO: Stores all events for later inspection (optional)
- ‚ö° Built with FastAPI + async SQLAlchemy

## Getting Started

### üîß Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hexkit/hookdrop.git
cd hookdrop
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üöÄ Run Locally

python3 main.py
```

## Usage

### Create a tunnel

```http
POST /tunnels
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "target_url": "https://your.domain.com/webhook"
}
```

### Forward incoming request

```http
POST /hook/{tunnel_id}/some/path
```

This will forward the request to:

```
{target_url}/some/path
```

with original headers, body, and method.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/hook/abc123/notify -d '{"event": "test"}'
```
