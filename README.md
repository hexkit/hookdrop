# Webhook Tunnel

A minimal, open-source HTTP webhook tunnel service built with FastAPI.

This project allows you to create temporary webhook URLs that forward incoming HTTP requests to your specified `target_url`. Useful for testing, debugging, or capturing events from third-party services.

## Usage

### Create a tunnel

```http
POST /tunnels
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "target_url": "https://your.domain.com/webhook"
}
```

### Forward incoming request

```http
POST /hook/{tunnel_id}/some/path
```

This will forward the request to:

```
{target_url}/some/path
```

with original headers, body, and method.
